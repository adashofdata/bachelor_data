# Bachelor and Bachelorette Data

This repo contains the data that I collected to do the analysis for this blog post: http://adashofdata.com/2015/02/18/the-data-behind-the-bachelor-the-bachelorette/

The data set contains details about the contestants from the Bachelor and Bachelorette TV shows from 2002-2015. I gathered the data by scraping the Wikipedia pages for each season and also filling in any missing information by manually searching for the info via Google.

To access the data, you can either:
* Click on the Bachelor_Data.xlsx spreadsheet and then click the Download button at the top right
* Click on each .csv file to view the three data sets that are contained in the spreadsheet
